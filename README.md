# PianoConnect

## Project Overview:
PianoConnect is a piano simulator app created using App Inventor. 
The app lets users connect to various Bluetooth-enabled devices using a BLE (Bluetooth Low-Energy) plugin.

The app features a Bluetooth service scan to detect nearby devices, ensuring seamless connectivity and interaction. 
To ensure the scan's proper functioning, Bluetooth and location services must be enabled on the user's device.

## Features:
- Piano simulation interface.
- BLE connectivity for device interaction.
- Service UUID-based device connection.
- Bluetooth service scan to detect and connect to nearby devices.
- Requires Bluetooth and location services to be enabled.
  
### How to Use:
Install the PianoConnect app on your device.
Ensure Bluetooth and location services are enabled.
Open the app and start the Bluetooth service scan to find nearby devices.
Select a device from the scan results to connect using the provided Service UUID.
Once connected, enjoy the piano simulation experience.

### Technical Requirements:
Android device with Bluetooth capability.
Bluetooth and location services must be enabled.
App Inventor environment for any custom modifications.
